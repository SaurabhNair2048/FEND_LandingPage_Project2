                        Animation is the process of creating the illusion of motion. What this means is that, even if the actual character is not moving in reality, but it seems to the viewer's eyes that the character is moving. So, in short, it's the art of creating illusion of motion.

                        Getting a little on the scientific side of the topic, <b><u>"Do you know why we get the illusion of motion?"</u></b>
                        <br>Our eyes have a retention capacity. What this menas is that, when a light falls on our retina and excites the cells, the cells remain in the excited state, even after the source of light has stopped. It has been found to be close to 1/20 of a second. So, if we show a person, a sequence of images with very little variations at about more than 20 images per second, the person won't be able to distinguish that it's a sequence of image. Instead it will seem like a continuous motion.<br> <b>Note:</b>The difference in the images should be small, or else it will look like sudden movements to the viewer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="data-style">
                        So, as per accepted standards, a minimum of 24 frames per second or images per second is needed to create a perfectly smooth illusion of motion to the user. And animation is the art of creating this illusion. That was just a brief overview of what "Animation" is.<br>

                    <p class="data-style">
                        Cell Animation is the most traditional and well known type of animation. Though, in the recent times, it may be possible to sometimes consider it as 2D Animation, since computers have taken over most of the animation industry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="data-style">
                        What <b>Cell Animation</b> is, is the basic art form of motion, which I believe almost everyone has performed as a kid, even though we didn't know it was cell animation. In cell animation, the animator creates a series of images, each slightly different from the previous in some aspect, but not vastly different. To put it simply, it's like a flip book we usually create as a kid, but on a larger scale. Then once all these images are created, these images are shown to a viewer, one after the other at a rate of about 24 picures per second. This creates an illusion od motion. The animator usually creates the images on sheets also called cells. So the name cell animation.

                    <p class="data-style">
                        Clay animation, is the form of animation, where the animator uses models to create an animation. Now-a-days, the models used are maybe toys or playdoh type of things. But in earlier days, clay dolls were used. Hence the name clay animation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="data-style">
                        How clay animation works is that, the user uses clay dolls as models posing them in different positions and poses to make a story. The animator then takes a lot of photos or pictures of the models in differnt positions with minor differences, to create an illusion of movement. The important thing about clay animation is that, the required number of people or staff is less. Unless you are trying to add audio to the animation, which will be as people intensive as in any other form of animation. It does require a high skill of understanding of body language and ergonomics just like in any other form of animation.

                    <p class="data-style">
                        2D animation is they type of animation, where we create characters in the 2D plane. The way it is differnt from cell animation is that, 2D animation is a term, usually used to refer to 2D animations created using a computer software or tools.
                    </p>
                    <p class="data-style">
                        2D animations can be considered to be the cartoons which are created for the kids. Some of the most popular examples now-a-days, can be considered to be Doraemon animated series, Shin Chan etc. These series are created by drawinf the characters on a 2D plane. The animator needs to have a good understanding of lighting as well, as the shadows need to drawn manually to create more realistic effect. In this case, since the animator is using a computer, the animator does not need to create all the frames or images in the animation. The animator only needs to focus on key frames, which can be considered to have considerable differences between each other while still having relationship between the key frames. The key frames should not be completely unrelated. This is because, the intermediate frames which are required to create the illusion of movement or motion is created or generated by the computer itself. If the key frames are not easily relatable, the computer may behave strangely and create quite unique but incorrect intermediate frames. This will result in the need for rework and quite delay in the production. The 2D animation software or tools also provide the user with various options to add effects to their animation to make it more realistic and reducing the workload of the animator.

                    <p class="data-style">
                        3D animation is another type of computer animation. it is the type of computer animation which is highly compute intensive, if you want a more realistic rendering of your animation. Rendering is the term used in 3D animation to mean generating the animation using the 3D softwares. It is called rendering because, in 3D animation ,the animator doesn't need to create the shadows and its affects. The aniamtor instead needs to have a good understanding of the materials the models are crated of. What their texture is and their hardness, roughness, etc. The animator needs to specify these details. here I am using the term animator in a more general sense. In the industry, the animator is someone who makes the motion details for the models. The models themselves are created by modellers who should know about all physical attributes of a material. There are others who perform texturing and others who perform lighting. But here I have used the term animator in general for all of them. The lighting and shadows are calculated by the 3D softwares rendering engine which is quite compute intensive.

                    <p class="data-style">
                        The major difference between 2D and 3D is that, in 2D it's more like the characters are drawn on a plane, whereas in 3D, the characters are modelled and placed in an environment created in a 3D software where the light and everything else interacts in as much of a realistic way as possible. There has been a boom in the the 3D animation market recently and with VR and AR and the desire for a more realistic experience is driving the 3D field.
