# Landing Page Project
## This is a custom page I've created with content that may not be completely accurate, but made for test purpose

* Index page contains 3 main parts:
    * Header
    * Content
    * Footer
* Header and Footer are made to have fixed position, at the top and bottom respectively
* The content is displayed between them in a scrollable window.
* Content consists of **6 different sections**.
* The header has a navbar dynamically populated on load, with links to different sections of the page.
* On clicking the link the section is scrolled into view.
* On scrolling through the page, the current active section has a different background. The navbar link associated with this section also has a different background.
* The navbar is set to disappear 2 seconds after a scroll event has been fired. It still needs improvement to overwrite the timer after the second scroll has been performed within 2 seconds.
